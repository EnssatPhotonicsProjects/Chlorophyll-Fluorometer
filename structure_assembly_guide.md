# Assembly Guide for Support Structures

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to assemble the Chlorophyll-Fluorometer structures.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the assembly process, ensure you have the following tools and components ready:

- Components from the [Components List](hardware/components.md)
- PVC glue
- Sandpaper
- PVC stripper
- Laser cutter
- Screws, nuts, washers
- Paper towel or rag
- Wires (red and black)
- Soldering station



## Step 1 : Assemble the LEDs and photodiode support

Start by soldering wires to the LEDs and photodiode terminal. Pay attention to the polarity of the terminals : you can solder a red wire on the + terminals of the LED and the cathode terminal of the photodiode. A black wire can be soldered on the - terminals of the LEDs and on the anode of the photodiode.

When this is done, you can assemble de following components :
- Two LEDs
- Photodiode
- (Red filter : 16 x 20 mm) X3
- 3D printed support
- Seal

1. Position the LEDs in their slots. If they don't fit, you can lightly file the LEDs bases. The LEDs must be perfectly held by the support and must not move. The wires must come out of the back of the bracket.

2. Position the photodiode in its slot. Bend the wires to make them come out of the back of the bracket.

3. Add the three pieces of red filter. You can slide them in the photodiode slot, this will hold everything in place in the holder. However, make sure that the filters are perfectly flat on the photodiode, or light could pass underneath. You can add a small piece of scotch tape to the end of the filters and fold it over the photodiode so that nothing escapes.

4. Glue the seal under the support.
