# Arduino Model
This project is designed to work with any Arduino Uno board compatible with the ATmega328 microcontroller or similar.

# Required Libraries
The following Arduino libraries are required to compile and run this project:

1. Wire.h
   - Included with Arduino IDE
   - Used for I2C communication.

2. Adafruit_ADS1X15.h
   - Available via Arduino Library Manager
   - Used for interfacing with the ADS1115 ADC.

3. Adafruit_GFX.h
   - Available via Arduino Library Manager
   - Core graphics library for displaying text and shapes on displays.

4. Adafruit_SSD1306.h
   - Available via Arduino Library Manager
   - Driver for the SSD1306 OLED display.

# Installation Instructions
To install the required libraries:
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
3. Search for each library by name and install it.

# Additional Setup
Ensure that your I2C devices (ADS1115 and SSD1306) are correctly connected to the Arduino I2C pins (A4 for SDA and A5 for SCL).
